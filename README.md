# Release Name Generator

Generates a release name from groups of word listings.  Created because coming up with unique lizard names 
for CodeLighthouse releases was old.  There are only so many pairings of `adjective + Lizard` that the human brain can
come up with.  So, in typical programmer fashion, I automated it.
